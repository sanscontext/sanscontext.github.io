# When all you have is a hammer: Hacking the SSG

Static site generators (SSGs) offer immense portability and flexibility - at the low-low cost of supporting your build chain yourself. But as with all trade-offs, this brings opportunity to take matters into your own hands. Opportunity to script your own extensions, build your own tools to answer questions about your own docs, and change your destiny. (Or at least your team's destiny!)

In this talk, I'll discuss different types of clever SSG modifications, from quality of life fixes, to docs team utilities, to integrations with both static and dynamic offsite content. As a bonus, I can touch on how AI/LLMs/ChatGPT can open this world up to anyone who can frame their problem in the form of a question.

This talk will be of interest to anyone in the docs as code world, but especially those who are either already using free open-source software (FOSS) SSGs, those who are considering switching to one, and hacker-types who like tinkering and scripting their way around problems.

My name is Laura Rubin and I've been a tech writer for 17 years, half of which have been spent in various SSG writing environments (Hugo, Jekyll, Metalsmith, Eleventy). I've seen everything from print to CHM to wiki to modern live-publish systems.  A few years back I stopped thinking of SSGs as a sometimes-grouchy tool for producing docs sites, and started thinking of them as a general-purpose computing machine, that you could use to run a lot of different routines - provided that you could figure out how to format them in a way the SSG would understand.
