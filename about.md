To speak in the first person briefly, I've lived an interesting life and that's brought me a wide array of experiences, interests, and hobbies. I've worked in food service, set carpentry, costume design, government data entry, event production, videoconference technology, and tier-two customer support - and that's just _before_ I found my actual career path.

Within my career path I've been a technical writer for both print and online content, a UX researcher and designer, a product manager, program manager, instructional designer, trainer, and information architect.
