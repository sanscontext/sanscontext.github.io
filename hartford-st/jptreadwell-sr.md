James Parker Treadwell
The 1894 block book shows the entire block owned by J P Treadwell, (James Parker Treadwell) who had a lot of personal drama but who was a lawyer, not a miner.  (He also sued a SF business after he was in an elevator fall, and left his capacious estate in such absolute chaos that it was in probate court and appeals until at least 1904.
Bancroft (yes of library fame) wrote about him here:
