title: Olivet Congregational Church
---


On the tiny diagonal slip of land at the southwest corner of 17th and Noe you can see a tiny church sitting squeezed between fences. That weird diagonal line is the edge of the original Rancho San Miguel land grant, so that parcel is just out of a contested area. (You can actually still see this border in satellite photos of the buildings along upper Market st.)

This corner lot was so tiny that the owners donated it to the Olivet Congregational Church, who built there anyway. However in 1908 the Olivet Congregational Church merged with the Third Congregational Church to form the Mission Congregational Church, and having outgrown their pocket-sized facility, Olivet returned the land to the original owners, Jacob A. Fisher and James Coyle. (They bought the surrounding weird cut-off lots and divided it between themselves, then sold the consolidated now-rectangular parcels on.) Together the two congregations raised funds to build a new, bigger church at 601 Dolores, which started construction in 1909 and opened on July 2nd 1911. They later merged with the First Congregational Church and moved to Polk St.
In 2015 the old-new church on Dolores was renovated to become the Children's Day School Middle School.
